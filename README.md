#🎮 Task 03 Completed – Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application ❌⭕

I built an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where users can play against each other or challenge the computer. This project combines fun gameplay with essential web development concepts.

✨ Key Features:
✅ Play mode: Player vs Player / Player vs Computer
✅ Handles user clicks and tracks game state
✅ Winning condition checks with real-time updates
✅ Simple, engaging, and responsive UI

This project enhanced my understanding of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and game state management, while making coding a lot more fun!

💡 Looking forward to building more interactive projects ahead.
